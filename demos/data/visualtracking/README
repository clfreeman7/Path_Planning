All .mat files consists of tracking data.
Capture rate at 30fps.

The files are 'n x 48' matrix.
n --> Number of frames.

Matlab commands used to structure the data:

theta_G(k,:) = reshape(Rot_G,[1,9]);   % Rotation matrix w.r.t 1st frame
trans_G(k,:) = T_G';                   % Translation matrix w.r.t 1st frame

% Collectively writing all the tracked points in a single variable.
all_pt = cat(2,centroid1,centroid2,centroid3,centroid4,centroid5,centroid6,...
             centroid7,centroid8,theta,trans,theta_G,trans_G);

They are structured as follows:

Columns             Respective Datas
1  to 3  (1x3)      Marker 1 [x,y,z]
4  to 6  (1x3)      Marker 2 [x,y,z]
7  to 9  (1x3)      Marker 3 [x,y,z]
10 to 12 (1x3)      Marker 4 [x,y,z]
13 to 15 (1x3)      Marker 5 [x,y,z]
16 to 18 (1x3)      Marker 6 [x,y,z]
19 to 21 (1x3)      Marker 7 [x,y,z]
22 to 24 (1x3)      Marker 8 [x,y,z]
25 to 33 (1x9)      Rotation matrix Intermediate frames [Reshaped from 3x3 to 1x9]
34 to 36 (1x3)      Translation Matrix Intermediate frames [[x,y,z]Reshaped from 3x1 to 1x3] 
37 to 45 (1x9)      Rotation matrix Global frame [Reshaped from 3x3 to 1x9]
46 to 48 (1x3)      Translation Matrix Global frame [[x,y,z]Reshaped from 3x1 to 1x3]
