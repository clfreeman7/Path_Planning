## Gait Library
The gait library (an array of Gait() objects that details each gait's change in robot pose and other attributes) is generated by running [demo_Gait.m](/demos/demo_Gait.m). The structure of the dependencies, as well as the connections to classes in other demos are shown below:

- **ExperimentalData**
This superclass is used for generalized analysis of Arun's visual tracking data. 
- **PrimitivesTest**
This ExperimentalData subclass is used for processing motion primitive data resulting from having the robot execute Euler tours (exhaustive exploration). Demos can be found in [demo_PrimitivesTest.m](/demos/demo_PrimitivesTest.m) and [demo2_PrimitivesTest.m](/demos/demo2_PrimitivesTest.m).
- **GaitTest**
This ExperimentalData subclass is used for processing sequentially repeated gaits, usually found via gait synthesis. The gaits are typically repeated for 30 cycles. A demo is shown in [demo_PrimitivesTest.m](/demos/demo_PrimitivesTest.m).
- **PathTest**
_(future implementation)_ This ExperimentalData subclass is used for processing open-loop gait-switching sequences. 
- **GaitSynthesizer**
This handle class is used to syntehsize (generate) gaits by incorporating the motion primitive data. A demo is shown in [demo_GaitSynthesizer.m](/demos/demo_GaitSynthesizer.m).
- **OldGaitTest**
_(future implementation)_
- **GaitPredict**
_(future implementation)_
- **Gait** 
This handle class is used to instantiate gait objects to form a gait library /database using one of three inputs: (1) a GaitTest() object which analyzes the data from visual tracking, (2) an OldGaitTest() object which analyses the data from manual visual tracking , or (3) a GaitPredict() object which uses motion primitive data to predict the behavior of gaits before testing them.
